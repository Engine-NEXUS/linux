//! TTS — 2-tier fallback: edge-tts (cloud) → Kokoro (local).
//!
//! Phase 2 architecture:
//!   Primary:   edge-tts (Microsoft Neural, cloud, $0, ~200ms, 0 MB RAM)
//!   Fallback:  Kokoro-82M (local ONNX, $0, ~real-time on CPU, ~260-370 MB RAM while loaded,
//!              lazy-loaded + unloaded after 10 min of stable network). Piper was removed (GPL espeak-ng).
//!
//! Cached acknowledgment phrases ("On it sir", etc.) are pre-synthesized at
//! boot using edge-tts and stored as f32 PCM in RAM. Playback is <5ms
//! regardless of which engine generated them.
